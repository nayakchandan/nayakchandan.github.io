Project 1
Document Search – cleaned a large corpus to convert unstructured text to structured tokens using SpaCy, implemented object oriented hash tables and webpages with Jinja templates to return results to the user.

Project 2
Neural Network for recommender system – built and fine-tuned embedding space to represent users and items, designed neural network class in Pytorch with customized forward pass to include additional features in training loop. Generated additional training data with negative sampling.
